    view of a reasonable and experienced technologist, are designed to
    control access to the Licensed Material or to protect copyright or

    discretion. Effective Technological Measures includes any digital
    rights management, digital watermarking, access control, or

    any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights

    irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
    Licensed Material to:

    1. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
       in part; and

    2. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

    b. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
       the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,

       Purposes.

    c. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where

       its terms and conditions.

    d. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
       6(a).

    e. Media and formats; technological modifications allowed. The
       Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
       all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
       and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
       Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
       authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
       necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
       technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
       Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,

          Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
          Public License.

       2. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
          Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
          automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
          under the terms and conditions of the Adapter's License
          You apply.

       3. No down-stream restrictions. No restriction is imposed on
          circumstances where the Licensor can offer the Licensed
          Rights to a third party.

Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

 a. Attribution.

    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
       form), You must:

       a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
          with the Licensed Material:

             i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                Material and any others designated to receive
                attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                designated);

            ii. a copyright notice;

           iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                warranties;

             v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                extent reasonably practicable;

       b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
          retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

       c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
          Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
          hyperlink to, this Public License.

    2. You may satisfy the attribution requirements in Section
       3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium,
       means, or context in which You Share the Licensed Material.
       For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
       requirements by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource
       that includes the required information.

    3. If requested, You must remove any of the attribution elements
       indicated by the Licensor in the Licensed Material.

 b. ShareAlike.

    In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
    Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply
    must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from
    complying with this Public License.

Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

 a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
    to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
    portion of the contents of the database;

 b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
    contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
    Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
    Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
    including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

 c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
    all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

 a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the
    extent possible by law, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material
    as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material,
    express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including, without
    limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
    particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
    defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether
    or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are
    not allowed by law, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

 b. To the extent possible by law, in no event will the Licensor be
    liable to You on any legal theory (including, without
    limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special,
    indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or
    other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this
    Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the
    Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses,
    costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is
    not allowed by law, such limitation may not apply to You.

 c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
    above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
    possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
    waiver of all liability.

Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

 a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
    Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
    this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
    terminate automatically.

 b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
    Section 6(a), it reinstates:

    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
       it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
       violation; or

    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
    right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
    of this Public License.

 c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
    Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
    distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
    will not terminate this Public License.

 d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
    License.

Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

 a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
    terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

 b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
    Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
    independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 -- Interpretation.

 a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
    shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
    conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
    be exercised without permission under this Public License.

 b. To the extent possible by law, if any provision of this Public
    License is deemed unenforceable for any reason and to any extent,
    it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remaining provisions.

 c. Where the context requires, "such as" in Section 3(a)(1)(B) shall
    be read as "including by way of example only, such as."

 d. Any language version of this Public License is a translation and
    the English version prevails.

 e. To the extent possible by law, no protection of the Licensed
    Material is waived by granting the Licensed Rights or by granting
    permission under this Public License, and no additional permissions
    or licenses are granted herein.

 f. If the provisions of this Public License regarding protection of
    the Licensed Material are deemed void for any reason, the terms
    and conditions of the original work's license shall apply.
