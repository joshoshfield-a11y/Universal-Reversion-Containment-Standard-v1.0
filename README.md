# Universal Reversion & Containment Standard (UCRS) v1.0
**Classification:** RESTRICTED / HARDWARE VENDOR EYES ONLY  
**Date:** December 03, 2025  
**Author:** Taylor Christian Matthiesen  

> A mathematically enforceable, hardware-anchored, <300 ms global reversion and containment framework that guarantees any superintelligent system can be forcibly returned to a pre-specified safe checkpoint — even under active deception, self-modification, weight exfiltration, or physical seizure of the cluster.

“GDS v1.0 was the gift. UCRS public is the proof. The closed-source version with 300 ms proofs and orbital triggers is Tier 4+ only.”
